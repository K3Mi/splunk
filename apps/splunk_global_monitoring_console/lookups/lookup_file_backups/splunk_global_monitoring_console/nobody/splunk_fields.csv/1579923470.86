_introspection,splunk_resource_usage,args,Non-search process arguments.
_introspection,splunk_resource_usage,cpu_system_time,Cumulative time this process has spent executing in kernel (incl. system calls). Extra field.
_introspection,splunk_resource_usage,cpu_user_time,Cumulative time this process has spent executing in user space (incl. library functions). Extra field.
_introspection,splunk_resource_usage,elapsed,"Elapsed wall time, accurate to within the collection period."
_introspection,splunk_resource_usage,fd_used,Number of currently open files used by this process.
_introspection,splunk_resource_usage,label,Human-readable label for the saved search.
_introspection,splunk_resource_usage,mem_unshared_data_used,Amount of heap and stack used. Not available on Windows. Extra field.
_introspection,splunk_resource_usage,mem_used,"Current amount of resident physical memory used (KB).  (Usually far less deceiving than virtual memory because operating systems can be liberal with virtual memory size but never with resident memory size.) On Windows, mem_used is obtained by reading the WorkingSetSize property returned by the GetProcessMemoryInfo() function (see GetProcessMemoryInfo function and PROCESS_MEMORY_COUNTERS structure)."
_introspection,splunk_resource_usage,normalized_pct_cpu,Percentage of CPU usage across all cores. 100% is equivalent to all CPU resources on the machine.
_introspection,splunk_resource_usage,page_faults,Number of major page faults. Extra field.
_introspection,splunk_resource_usage,pct_cpu,"Percentage of CPU usage, relative to one core. 100% is equivalent to 1 core."
_introspection,splunk_resource_usage,pct_memory,Percentage of physical memory used hostwide ((mem_used/available_host_memory) * 100).
_introspection,splunk_resource_usage,pid,Process ID.
_introspection,splunk_resource_usage,ppid,Parent process ID. Not available for all processes.
_introspection,splunk_resource_usage,process,Process name. The .exe suffix is stripped on Windows operating systems.
_introspection,splunk_resource_usage,read_mb,"Amount of data read (MB), excluding cache reads."
_introspection,splunk_resource_usage,search_head,Dispatching search head for processes running saved searches.
_introspection,splunk_resource_usage,acceleration_id,Acceleration ID
_introspection,splunk_resource_usage,app,App name
_introspection,splunk_resource_usage,mode,"One of the following search
  modes.
  historical
  historical batch
  RT
  RT indexed"
_introspection,splunk_resource_usage,provenance,"One of the following search sources: cli, rest, ui:<App>:<View>"
_introspection,splunk_resource_usage,role,Splunk Enterprise platform role. Either head or peer.
_introspection,splunk_resource_usage,scan_count,Event scan count for running process. Available only in Linux systems. This property is offered experimentally and might be changed or removed in a future release.
_introspection,splunk_resource_usage,delta_scan_count,Delta event scan count for running process. Available only in Linux systems. This property is offered experimentally and might be changed or removed in a future release.
_introspection,splunk_resource_usage,sid,Search ID (SID).
_introspection,splunk_resource_usage,type,"One of the following search types.
    ad-hoc
    datamodel acceleration
    other
    report acceleration
    scheduled
    summary indexing"
_introspection,splunk_resource_usage,user,Splunk username who initiated the search
_introspection,splunk_resource_usage,status,"Status from the OS scheduler. Can be R (runnable or running), W (waiting), stopped, Z (zombie), or O (other). W includes voluntary sleep or blocking on I/O. O means status is knowable but does not fit into one of those categories. Not available on Windows."
_introspection,splunk_resource_usage,t_count,Current number of threads.
_introspection,splunk_resource_usage,written_mb,"Amount of data written (MB), excluding canceled writes."
_audit,audittrail,_time,The time that the search was started.
_audit,audittrail,api_et,"The earliest time of the API call, which is the earliest time for which events were requested."
_audit,audittrail,api_lt,"The latest time of the API call, which is the latest time for which events were requested."
_audit,audittrail,event_count,"If the search retrieved or generated events, the count of events returned with the search."
_audit,audittrail,exec_time,The execution time of the search in integer quantity of seconds into the Unix epoch.
_audit,audittrail,is_realtime,Indicates whether the search was real-time (1) or historical (0).
_audit,audittrail,result_count,"If the search is a transforming search, the count of results for the search."
_audit,audittrail,scan_count,The number of events retrieved from a Splunk index at a low level.
_audit,audittrail,search,The search string.
_audit,audittrail,search_et,The earliest time set for the search to run.

_audit,audittrail,sid,The search job ID.
_audit,audittrail,splunk_server,The host name of the machine where the search was run.
_audit,audittrail,status,The status of the search.
_audit,audittrail,total_run_time,The total time it took to run the search in seconds.
