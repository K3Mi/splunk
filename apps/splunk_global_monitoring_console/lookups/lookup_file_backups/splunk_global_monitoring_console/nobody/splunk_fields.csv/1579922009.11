Index,Sourcetype,Field_Name,Field_Description,Column6
_introspection,splunk_resource_usage,args,Non-search process arguments.,
,,cpu_system_time,Cumulative time this process has spent executing in kernel (incl. system calls). Extra field.,
,,cpu_user_time,Cumulative time this process has spent executing in user space (incl. library functions). Extra field.,
,,elapsed,"Elapsed wall time, accurate to within the collection period.",
,,fd_used,Number of currently open files used by this process.,
,,label,Human-readable label for the saved search.,
,,mem_unshared_data_used,Amount of heap and stack used. Not available on Windows. Extra field.,
,,mem_used,"Current amount of resident physical memory used (KB).  (Usually far less deceiving than virtual memory because operating systems can be liberal with virtual memory size but never with resident memory size.) On Windows, mem_used is obtained by reading the WorkingSetSize property returned by the GetProcessMemoryInfo() function (see GetProcessMemoryInfo function and PROCESS_MEMORY_COUNTERS structure).",
,,normalized_pct_cpu,Percentage of CPU usage across all cores. 100% is equivalent to all CPU resources on the machine.,
,,page_faults,Number of major page faults. Extra field.,
,,pct_cpu,"Percentage of CPU usage, relative to one core. 100% is equivalent to 1 core.",
,,pct_memory,Percentage of physical memory used hostwide ((mem_used/available_host_memory) * 100).,
,,pid,Process ID.,
,,ppid,Parent process ID. Not available for all processes.,
,,process,Process name. The .exe suffix is stripped on Windows operating systems.,
,,read_mb,"Amount of data read (MB), excluding cache reads.",
,,search_head,Dispatching search head for processes running saved searches.,
,,acceleration_id,Acceleration ID,
,,app,App name,
,,mode,"One of the following search
  modes.
  historical
  historical batch
  RT
  RT indexed",
,,provenance,"One of the following search sources: cli, rest, ui:<App>:<View>",
,,role,Splunk Enterprise platform role. Either head or peer.,
,,scan_count,Event scan count for running process. Available only in Linux systems. This property is offered experimentally and might be changed or removed in a future release.,
,,delta_scan_count,Delta event scan count for running process. Available only in Linux systems. This property is offered experimentally and might be changed or removed in a future release.,
,,sid,Search ID (SID).,
,,type,"One of the following search types.
    ad-hoc
    datamodel acceleration
    other
    report acceleration
    scheduled
    summary indexing",
,,user,Splunk username who initiated the search,
,,status,"Status from the OS scheduler. Can be R (runnable or running), W (waiting), stopped, Z (zombie), or O (other). W includes voluntary sleep or blocking on I/O. O means status is knowable but does not fit into one of those categories. Not available on Windows.",
,,t_count,Current number of threads.,
,,written_mb,"Amount of data written (MB), excluding canceled writes.",
